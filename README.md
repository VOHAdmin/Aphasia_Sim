<b><i>Voices of Hope for Aphasia</i></b>

Aphasia Simulations module was developed as a collaboration project
between Dr. Jacqueline Hinckley and Keen Research. Dr. Hinckley is a
consultant in St. Petersburg, FL and Associate Professor Emeritus in
Communication Sciences & Disorders at the University of South Florida.
Keen Research develops software development kits for on-device speech
recognition for mobile devices. In the past, when Aphasia Simulations
were developed, Keen Research has experimented with various online
services focused on helping with speech rehabilitation of people with
aphasia.

This site was updated for use with the new Voices of Hope for Aphasia 
website in collaboration with the University of Florida Chapter of the 
Association for Information Systems pro-bono consulting operations.
