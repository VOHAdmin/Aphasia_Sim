      <h2>What is Aphasia?</h2>
      
      <div id="simulation">
        <div id="sim-content">
          <p>Aphasia is a communication impairment that <strong>affects</strong> all aspects of language, including <strong>speaking, understanding speech, reading, and writing</strong>. Imagine going to a foreign country where you do not speak the language, or you only remember a few words from your high school or college language course. You would have difficulty saying what you mean, understanding what others were saying to you, reading the language, and writing things down. This provides a little insight into what it might be like to have aphasia.</p>

<p>Aphasia is caused by a brain injury, typically due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some other illness. Depending on the exact location of the brain injury, aphasia can manifest itself in many different ways. Some people with aphasia have more <strong>difficulty understanding what is said to them and reading</strong> than they do speaking. Other people with aphasia have more <strong>difficulty saying what they want to say but understand much of what is said to them</strong>. Sometimes aphasia is more severe and affects understanding, speaking, reading and writing quite broadly.</p>

<p>Because there are different types of aphasia, not all of the simulations on this website will apply equally to everyone with aphasia. It is best to consult with a rehabilitation professional, such as your speech-language pathologist or your physician, to find out more about exactly the type of aphasia that applies to you or someone you know. These simulations can help you understand the different types of problems that people with aphasia might have.</p>
